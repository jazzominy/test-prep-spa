## A simple single page app using Nodejs, Angular 1.5 and Bootstrap

#### Prerequisites
To run this application, [node](http://nodejs.org/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) should be installed

#### To set up the app

* Clone the project using `git clone https://github.com/jazzominy/test-prep-spa.git`
* Then go to project directory `cd test-prep`
* Then run `npm install` to download the dependencies. On successful installation, `node_modules` folder will be created
* Now run `bower install` to install bower components. On successful installation, `ui/bower_components` folder will be created
* To build the project and run the server, execute `npm start`. If everything goes well, the console will display the message - `Server running at port 5000`

Now you can access the app at `localhost:5000`
